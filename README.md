### üëã About Me

I'm a final-year Computer Science & Engineering student at KUET (**Merit Position: 9th/121**) with a passion for turning complex data into actionable insights. 

While my academic research is rooted in **Cryptography and Blockchain**, my project work is focused on the practical application of **Data Analysis and Machine Learning**. I excel at using **Python** for in-depth statistical analysis and building predictive models, and I am highly proficient in **SQL** for extracting and manipulating data from relational databases. I am actively seeking a Data Analyst role where I can apply my analytical skills to solve real-world business problems.
